# Envio Configuration Strategy

## Current Problem

The contract addresses in config.yaml don't exist on Monad testnet, so Envio has "nothing to fetch."

## Solutions

### Option 1: Deploy Test ERC20 Token

Deploy a simple ERC20 token to Monad testnet and use that address.

### Option 2: Use Wildcard with Topic Filter

Configure Envio to listen for ALL Transfer events on the chain (requires Envio v2.31+)

### Option 3: Mock/Development Mode

Use Envio in local development mode with mock data for demo purposes.

## Recommended Approach for Hackathon

**Use a combination:**

1. Deploy a simple ERC20 token to Monad testnet
2. Make some test transfers
3. Configure Envio to index that specific contract
4. Generate sample data for demo

This ensures:

- Real blockchain integration (judges can verify)
- Actual Envio usage (qualifies for $1K bonus)
- Working demo (essential for hackathon)

## Implementation Steps

1. Create simple ERC20 contract
2. Deploy to Monad testnet
3. Mint tokens and make transfers
4. Update config.yaml with actual contract address
5. Restart Envio indexer
6. Verify data in GraphQL playground

## Alternative: Use Monad's Deployed Contracts

Check Monad testnet explorer for actual deployed ERC20 tokens and use those addresses instead.
