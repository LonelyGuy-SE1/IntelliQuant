# Token Metrics Indexer Schema
# This indexer aggregates metrics from the DEX indexer's GraphQL endpoint
# For the hackathon, metrics are calculated in the backend by querying the DEX indexer

# Placeholder entity - required for valid Envio schema
# Not actively used since this indexer doesn't index events directly
type TokenMetric @entity {
  id: ID!
  # Future: Add token health metrics here if needed
}
