## Submission Form Fields (Prepare Answers)

1. **Project Name**: IntelliQuant

2. **Tagline**: AI-Powered Portfolio Management on Monad with MetaMask Smart Accounts

3. **Description** (200 words):
```
IntelliQuant is a next-generation DeFi portfolio management platform that combines AI-powered analytics, real-time blockchain indexing, and secure delegated trading. Built on Monad testnet, it leverages MetaMask Smart Accounts for gasless, non-custodial automation.

Key features:
â€¢ AI Token Health Scoring: 0-100 scores with component breakdown (liquidity, stability, demand, slippage)
â€¢ Portfolio Risk Analysis: Drift detection, concentration risk, and smart money tracking
â€¢ Secure Delegations: Granular trading permissions with caveats (amount limits, target restrictions, call limits)
â€¢ Real-time Data: Envio HyperIndex indexers monitor DEX swaps, token transfers, and whale activity
â€¢ Gasless Execution: Paymaster-sponsored transactions for frictionless UX

IntelliQuant uses Envio's ultra-fast HyperSync to index millions of blockchain events, feeding an AI scoring engine that generates actionable recommendations. Users create MetaMask Smart Accounts, set portfolio targets, and optionally enable automated rebalancing through secure delegations. All execution happens on Monad's high-performance L1, delivering 400ms blocks and 800ms finality for responsive trading.

The platform is fully transparent, non-custodial, and user-controlled. Every AI recommendation includes detailed explanations, and all automated trades are logged with delegation metadata for complete auditability.
